1. In the dim_store_details table, clean the longitude and number_of_staff columns. 
   Reupload the table, and add in the necessary schema changes and constraints. 

2. Create sql scripts for the creation of the orders_table and the dim_store_details table 

3. Verify that the STAR schema model works by performing some joins to the table. 
   Currently, the foreign keys seem as if they are all nulls.

Solution to 3

UPDATE orders_table
SET card_key = dim_card_details.card_key
FROM dim_card_details
WHERE orders_table.card_number::varchar = dim_card_details.card_number;    

The following SQL Script allows this to happen, BUT 
The dim_card_details table is missing some keys. 
Will have to do some further investigation on this later; especially with the other tables.
