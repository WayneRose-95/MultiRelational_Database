1. In the dim_store_details table, clean the longitude and number_of_staff columns. 
   Reupload the table, and add in the necessary schema changes and constraints. (DONE)

2. Create sql scripts for the creation of the orders_table and the dim_store_details table (DONE)

3. Verify that the STAR schema model works by performing some joins to the table. 
   Currently, the foreign keys seem as if they are all nulls.

Solution to 3

UPDATE orders_table
SET card_key = dim_card_details.card_key
FROM dim_card_details
WHERE orders_table.card_number::varchar = dim_card_details.card_number;    

The following SQL Script allows this to happen, BUT 
The dim_card_details table is missing some keys. 
Will have to do some further investigation on this later; especially with the other tables. 

4. Foreign keys are not updating inside the orders_table 
   Fix the scripts so that the keys are updated inside the orders_table (DONE) 

5. Query the data warehouse: answering the following questions: 

How many stores does the business have an in which countries? 
Which locations currently have the most stores? 
Which months produce the average highest cost of sales typically? 
What percentage of sales come through each type of store? 
Which month in in each produced the highest cost of sales? 
What is our staff headcount? 
Which German store type is selling the most? 
How quickly is the company making sales? 

How many sales are coming from online? (Unsure because there's no online column)
